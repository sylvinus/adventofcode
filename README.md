# Advent of Code
My humble solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I'm usually optimizing for time-to-solution and then [code golfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) a fair bit so don't expect lots of comments :)

Most of them need to be run from their own directory with `python3`.

For those interested in such things, I recommend checking out Peter Norvig's [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)!

To init a new day, use this:

```YEAR=2015;DAY=06;mkdir -p $YEAR/$DAY;touch $YEAR/$DAY/input.txt;touch $YEAR/$DAY/part1.py;touch $YEAR/$DAY/part2.py;```
