# Advent of Code
My humble solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I'm usually optimizing for time-to-solution so don't expect lots of comments :)

Most of them need to be run from their own directory with `python3`.

For those interested in such things, I recommend checking out Peter Norvig's [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)!
